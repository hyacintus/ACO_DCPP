# Project Description

This project contains three main files:

# 1. loop-p.py
This script is used to execute the main script (Loop_per_articolo.py) multiple times. It automates the process of running the script repeatedly, which is useful for testing and conducting repeated analyses.

# 2. Loop_per_articolo.py
This is the main script that generates a directed graph with a specified number of nodes, a desired number of odd nodes, and a maximum number of edges. The script solves the problem using two methods:
- A recursive algorithm, which calculates all possible solutions to the problem.
- An Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm, which aims to optimize the solution found by the recursive algorithm.

# 3. funzioni_per_articolo.py
This file contains all the functions used by the main script (Loop_per_articolo.py). The functions are modular and are called during the execution of the process to handle operations related to graph generation and solving.

# Additional Details
The files are commented in Italian to explain the workings of each section and to facilitate understanding of the code.
Commented-out code: Some parts of the code are commented out as they are not necessary for the current functioning of the scripts, but they might serve as ideas for future modifications or extensions to the project.
